## Introduction
Urban mobility is a key component in the development of modern cities, and its analysis helps to understand transportation dynamics that affect quality of life, environmental sustainability, and economic efficiency. In a world where cities are experiencing exponential growth, understanding transportation usage patterns and their environmental impact has become essential for informed decision-making.

This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of urban mobility patterns, evaluating both public and private transportation, and exploring their relationship with greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions. Through comprehensive data analysis and the use of tools such as SQL, Python, and Power BI, the goal is to identify trends, correlations, and potential areas for improvement in transportation infrastructure and public policies.

The data used comes from various sources, including public transportation records, CO2 emissions, and demographic and economic factors. Integrating these datasets will allow for evidence-based recommendations that can contribute to the creation of more sustainable and efficient cities.
